# Digital Pizzaria
My project is a Digital Pizzaria platform enabling customers to order pizza online with ease and efficiency. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and customizing pizzas, ensuring a seamless ordering experience. The platform also includes a real-time delivery tracking feature, allowing customers to monitor their order's progress. This eliminates the need for customers to wait in line at the pizzeria or leave their homes.
